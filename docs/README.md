These diagram files exist to steer the SON into the right direction.

## What are they and how are they created?

Most of these HTML files are created via [draw.io Desktop](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases/).

I recommend downloading the app from the previous URL, over the [online edition of the app](https://app.diagrams.net/), but you can use the second link to test if you like it too.

## What are all these different diagrams?

Check out [this article by creately.com](https://creately.com/blog/diagrams/uml-diagram-types-examples/) to learn more about the different types of diagrams.

I tend to start with an [entity-relationship-model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model "This is what I based my ERM on") (ERM), because it's abstract, so I don't have to worry about the details quite yet.

After that comes a use case diagram (UCD), because I have to take into account WHO uses the system and the WHAT they need to be able to do - A step towards the concrete.

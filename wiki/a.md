# [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten)


This is a note-taking system, created by [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann). Maybe he was not the originator, he was VERY proficient in using it, creating over 90k notes in his life.

It supposedly helped him write a TON of books. Thing is, his system was physical. Not very suited for a virtual system. I will add my own twist on things to suit my own needs.

I will make use of tags for things I need to return to.

The tags I indent to use are:

```text
#BUG 
#FIXME
#HACK
#NOTE
#OPTIMIZE
#TODO
#XXX
```

#TODO check which ones I actually use; filter out the ones I do not end up using.

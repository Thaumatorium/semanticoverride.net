# Post

This is the main content that's posted to the site - I want it to be deeper than what Reddit provides.

It has to look *really* sharp. Very unlike Reddit's posts.

* [[b1|title]]
* [[b2|description]]
* [[b3|summary]]
* [[b4|comment count]]
* [[b5|posted iso date]]
* [[b6|published iso date]]
* [[b7|votes]]
* [[b8|tags]]
* [[b9|image]]

A post can be a [[b10|specific type]]

A post can contain [[c|comments]]

#requirement all dates must be ISO 8601. No discussion.

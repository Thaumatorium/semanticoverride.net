# Comment Filter

I'll need a filter to easy the moderation pains.

I can start with a simple word filter. If it is triggered, show a comment to the user that they've triggered the filter. If they still want to post (certain words), they still can, but if they receive enough downvotes, they'll get [[c2|tard-boxed]]

Beyond that, people will obviously code words to work around the filter, so we could use a more advanced algorithm to check if a word triggers the filter.

Also ban the user for [[d1]]. I'll have none of that shit.

#TODO check spark file for list of words to filter.

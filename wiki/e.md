# Phases

The development of SON is going through several phases, and for each phase it may need certain requirements that are going to be dropped later.

## Phase 1

Very base website - only posts and accounts (?) 

To ensure there is content to vote on, I should make a bot that posts from certain resources. This bot exists only to ensure content. Once users start posting their own content, I could consider phasing it out, but perhaps I should ask the users if they like the bot in the first place.

I could also just reduce its use, let users vote on which parts they want to keep or disregard.

#TODO Figure out how users can abuse the above system to fuck over certain sites and think of a way to prevent abuse.

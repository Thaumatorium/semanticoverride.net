# Voting

I don't want to restrict [[b7|votes]] to just posts; I want users to have a say into the development of the site. Maybe even let them vote to remove features?

#TODO I should figure out how to setup the voting system. Do I forward n items per week and let users vote on them? How it it going to work? Do I just have a giant list of features people can vote on? If something goes into the negative, it gets removed? What are the thresholds for this? How many votes does a user get? One up and one down? Is there a vote weighting, based on the age of the account that's voting? How should I weigh it? Logarithmically? How shall I order the features? Randomly? By votes, total (negative or positive)? By total points on the votes? But that means negative always ends up at the bottom, where people don't look, so nothing ever gets removed. Negative at the top?

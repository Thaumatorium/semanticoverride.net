# Fonts

Over the years I've tried a lot of fonts, but my favorite (as of 2022-11-15) is [`JetBrainsMono NF`](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/JetBrainsMono/Ligatures/Regular/complete) (get the `Windows Compatible` ones).

Before that I used [MesloLGS NF](https://github.com/romkatv/dotfiles-public/blob/master/.local/share/fonts/NerdFonts/MesloLGS%20NF%20Regular.ttf), because it looked like Consolas, but had [Powerlevel9k](https://www.google.com/search?q=Powerlevel9k&tbm=isch) icon support - I used a Bash version. Though [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) is available nowadays.

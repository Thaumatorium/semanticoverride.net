# Rules

What social rules are there going to be, what are they going to cover, what are they NOT going to cover.

These are going to be as explicit as I can be. I don't want to lean on any invisible implicit "we expect you to not do this" kind of rules.

Am I going to cover _literally everything_? Obviously not, as that's not practical, but I do want to cover _some_ obvious things, as it's not obvious to _everyone_.

## Follow Article 1 from the Dutch Constitution

Q: "But NostraDavid, I'm not from [not the Netherlands]! Why should _I_ follow (a subsection of) the Dutch law???"

A: "Because this is _my_ site and _I fucking said so_. Don't like it? Then get the fuck off my site, as I don't want you here fucking up the community and its culture."

I've seen too many communities being _way_ too open, which ends up changing the culture of the site for the worse. Then the site has to make rules, mass ban subsections of the site, drama all around. There's nothing fun about that kind of bullshit and I want to prevent this nonsense.

Q: "OK, that was a bit abrasive!?"

A: "I know, but I'm sick of people who come in bad faith, and try to troll around to de-rail a discussion. I've been on the internet since 1995 and I've seen a lot of bullshit and I'm sick of it. Another reason for this site - I think I can do better."

Q: "Eh, alright. But which laws are we expected to follow!?"

A: "Just Article 1 of the Constitution, which states 'All persons in the Netherlands shall be treated equally in equal circumstances. Discrimination on the
grounds of religion, belief, political opinion, race or sex or on any other grounds whatsoever shall not be
permitted.' This means no bullshit talk about race, sex, gender, whatever. **Yes, I know constitutions are not actual laws in and of themselves, but for the sake of this site, we're going to act like it is**"

Q: "Oh, you must be a snowflake liberal?"

A: "No, I'm just Dutch. Don't like it? Fuck off my site."

Q: "Another white male capitalist using his white privilige to rule a website"

A: "No, I'm just Dutch. Don't like it? Fuck off my site."

## Restricted entry

I do not want this site to grow too fast, because it will fuck up any community-generated culture in the long run.

I have thought about just adding a restriction on how many people can join the site per day, to restrict the growth and preserve the culture by ensuring the newcomers get the time to adopt the local culture, without the culture being overwhelmed by the amount of newcomers.

Yes, this will restrict the growth of the site, but it will also ensure its survivability of the site.

The reason for this is that [the death of Digg](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/digg-v4) had a negative impact of the social structure of Reddit due to the mass-migration of Digg users to Reddit. Reddit's culture got overwhelmed and basically died by migration.

I want to prevent that from happening to my site.

## No cursing

"fuck" and "ass" are fine, sure - people should be able to vent their frustration.

"Nigger" and "Sandnigger" are an obvious no-no, as the people who use those are either assholes, or needlessly arguing about its use. Fuck all of that.

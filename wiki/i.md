# Corporate Code

To ensure I have something to work towards; a guideline if you will, I'll write down the Barbossa Code

# Vision

**To have an _enjoyable_ place to share news, olds, articles, images.**

# Mission

I'm going to build my own news-aggregator, with blackjack and hookers! In fact, forget the news-aggregator!

# Core values

* Be the fastest running news-aggregator
* Disable the use of certain negative words by warning users whenever they try to use it
* Enable user protection to enable them to disable their PMs, silence users, silence reactions

# Strategy

* Research the fastest ways of running a site
* Build a superfast base; Try to run as little code as possible
* Create a system that includers users in all news, which they can filter out, instead of whatever Reddit is doing
* Limit inflow of users to keep a grip on the site's culture
* Enable self-written bots to generate content
* Find a way to enable money-flow to keep the site up

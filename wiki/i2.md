## What do I do to setup an automated pipeline to turn tracker/chiptune files into music videos on YouTube

There are several steps you can take to set up an automated pipeline to turn tracker/chiptune files into music videos on YouTube. Here are the general steps you can follow:

First, you will need to select a tracker/chiptune music file to use as the audio for your music video.

Next, you will need to create a video file that you want to use as the visual component of your music video. This can be a static image or a series of images, or even a short video clip.

Once you have your audio and video files ready, you can use a video editing software to combine the two files and create a single music video file. There are many video editing software options available, both free and paid, so you can choose the one that best fits your needs and preferences.

After you have created your music video file, you can upload it to YouTube. To do this, you will need to create a YouTube account if you don't already have one, and then use the YouTube uploader to upload your music video to your account.

Once your music video is uploaded to YouTube, you can then set up an automated pipeline to automatically publish it on your YouTube channel at a specific time or on a regular schedule. This can be done using a tool like Zapier, which allows you to automate various tasks and actions between different online platforms and services.

Overall, setting up an automated pipeline to turn tracker/chiptune files into music videos on YouTube is not too difficult, and can be done by following the steps outlined above.

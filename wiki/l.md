# Hugo installation for Windows

Am currently creating the application on Windows, as that's my default OS for the moment.

## Install Chocolatey

Delete `C:\ProgramData\chocolatey` if you want to install it fresh.

Open elevated Powershell and [install Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)

## Install Hugo-Extended

In the same elevated Powershell run `choco install hugo-extended`

## Optionally install go

In the same elevated Powershell run `choco install go`
